# Castor

This is a game engine using the actor pattern.

It uses the library SANDAL2 to handle graphics and SDL2_mixer for sound.

## Compiling

You need SANDAL2 ( and SDL2 ) to compile it.

```
> cd castor

> git submodule update --init

> mkdir build && cd build

> cmake ..

> make
```

## New Castor

I'm restarting the project to do a better game engine with a better conception and interface and will add a lot of new features (audio engine, network, shader, ...). It can be found [here](https://github.com/dabaldassi/castor-engine)
